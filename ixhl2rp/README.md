# HL2 RP Schema
A Half-Life 2 Roleplay schema for [Helix](https://github.com/nebulouscloud/helix).
#


# Core Changes 
The core changes are to the Schema/Factions/sh_citizen.lua & Identity System
The changes made to the sh_citizen are what spawns the citizen in with a "Transfer document," and assigns the items object data.
If you _DO NOT PULL_ these changes, the plugins Identity System, CTO, and Apartments _WILL NOT WORK_. 
#


#  Some thing(s) to note
Infestation System is a WIP plugin. It should be functional in its current state _in theory_, however we cannot confirm this at this point in time.
There's some function and var name changes we have to make within the plugin still.
This is also a DEV build of what we use live. So there is still zero guarantee otherwise that this schema works as is provided.
