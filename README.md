This is a fork of the hl2rp schema for Helix.

This schema is specifically designed for a private server, and many modifications will be made with, and without documentation outside of our Discord server.
If you don't know what you are doing, do NOT pull our plugins, you will not be able to use them.

I highly recommend getting started here and using plugins from the Plugin center first:

So this is a "for fun" project, and is namely for use as stated, on our private server. So there's a couple things to keep in mind when reading through our repo, and considering contributing. (For contributions, check the contributions template)

So let's keep in mind the following:

A) Like stated above, our repo is full of _MICROSERVICES_, which is why you _SHOULD NOT_ pull our individual plugins. If you'd like to use our plugins, due to the changes we make, and have made to the base ilx schema and other plugins, you will have to pull most of the repo. This is unfortunate for the modularity and simplicity of the project, however, the goal was never to share this outside of our community.

B) Aleuvian and I (Wachter/Upas-Source) have lives outside of gaming, and coding. So _do not_ expect pull requests, documentation, or changes to dealt with in a timely manor. This is a project he started for fun, and has been working on for a while. Which is also something I only quite recently joined, and am attempting to help with in my freetime. So there is no real time-table, or hours we consistently work on this repo. 

C) This is again, suppose to be for **FUN**, so please keep that mind when working on the repo or commenting on things. There will be spaghetti code, there will be syntax errors, and there will be issues to come. All of which will come and go as the schema expands and changes. It's natural, we expect it, and so should you.

D) There is a license for most of our original coding, you can check out our licensing and read through that. Which is something I __strongly__ suggest before attempting to fork this repo to make your own original work out of it.

E) And finally, have some fun, and roleplay.
